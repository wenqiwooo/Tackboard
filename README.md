# Tackboard

Helping each other is human nature and humanity is built on community. We help those around us, and hope that they will return the favour when we need help ourselves.

The Universal Tactboard is a platform specially created to encourage social giving and receiving within a local community.

Everytime you give to someone on the Universal Tactboard, you will earn a point from that person. You can then use this point to receive something in return from other people on the platform. This serves as the social currency for giving and receiving, and gives people the incentive to help others.

The first row shows your profile picture and your points. You must have points in order to receive from others. Each time you receive something, you will spend one point. Giving to others will earn you points.

To receive something, simply tell people what you need on the Universal Tactboard. It’s that intuitive!

See what other people need in the GIVE section. If you see something you can help someone with, give it a tick!

When someone has agreed to help you, it will be reflected in the UPDATES section. Don’t forget like the post else he or she will not receive any point.

The Universal Tactboard is also geolocation based. The people who can see your requests are those people who are geographically close to you and are very likely to be your colleagues or schoolmates whom you see everyday.

By promoting sharing and receiving, the Universal Tactboard also encourages greater social interaction and promotes the cohesiveness of your community. So what are you waiting for? Give it a try today!

Some people have already come up with some really creative uses for it. Disclaimer: Results may vary.
